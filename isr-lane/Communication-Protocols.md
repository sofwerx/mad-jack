These are the communication technologies used by the devices in the safe house.

## Wi-fi

Wi-fi is now a ubiquitous technology, and the most common standard used for IoT devices. Based on the IEEE 802.11 standtards, the technology communicates on either the 2.8GHz ultra high frequency band or the 5.8 GHz super high frequency band of the radio spectrum. It is used to wirelessly communicate on a LAN, and typically has a range of 32 meters.

## Bluetooth

Bluetooth is another common technology providing wireless communication between devices. Bluetooth is based off the IEEE and branding is handled by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group. It's designed to be a low-powered method of establishing Personal Area Networks over short distances. There are 4 classes of Bluetooth devices:

* Class 1: Class 1 devices have a effective range of up to 100 meters with a power level of 20 dBm. Generally, these are used for industrial applications.

* Class 2: Class 2 devices have a maximum effective range of 10 meters with a 4 dBm power level. Most consumer mobile devices, and all Bluetooth devices in the safe house, are class 2.

* Class 3: Class 3 devices have a range of up to 1 meter, with a power level of roughly 1 dBm.

* Class 4: Class 3 devices have a range of up to half a meter, with a power level of roughly .5 dBm.

Bluetooth uses the  2.4 to 2.485 GHz broadcast range.

## Z-Wave Plus

Z-Wave is a low power communication technology that operates on sub-gigahertz radio frequencies (licensed for 908.2MHz in the U.S.) This offers an advantage over similar wi-fi devices because the standard is impervious to the effects of signal crowding by an excess of gadgets using the 2.4GHz radio band. The drawback is that Z-Wave does not support a more sophisticated communication system than an ad-h
